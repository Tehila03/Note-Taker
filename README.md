# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

In this task, I was given the responsibility of developing an application called Note Taker, designed for writing and saving notes. The application utilizes an Express.js back end to store and retrieve user-generated note data from a JSON file. While the front end of the application has already been built, my role involves creating the back end, establishing the connection between the front and back end, and ultimately deploying the completed application on Heroku.
